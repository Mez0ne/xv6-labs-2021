Q:
Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A:
a0, a1, a2, ...;
a2 holds `13`.

Q:
Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

A:
Is's optimized, resulted in `li a1,12`.


Q:
At what address is the function printf located?
A:
1528.

Q:
What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A:
0x38.
010111111000 00001 000 00001 1100111


Q:
Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

A:
HE110 World
4321


Q:
In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
A:
Not sure, old a2's value.
